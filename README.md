\***\* to try in this app: \*\***

- Add and try out JS docs : https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc
- use SVGR for svg formatting https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack
- inspiration for add ons to the app come from: https://medium.com/@thekevinwang/react-%EF%B8%8F-tic-tac-toe-%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-extras-88e68f025772

\***\* Done: \*\***

1.  Refs to produce accurate and dynamic styling of elements
2.  state + prop drilling to passinformation from parent to child and vice versa
    \*\* in larger apps I would use app context to pass info around, in this case drilling is faster + good practice.
3.  global function store to reduce code throughout the app and make tracing mistakes easier.
4.  form validation using regex to avoid submitting empty or incorrect info
    \*\* in larger apps I would use 'Formiq', 'Yup' (frontend validation) and 'Joi' (backend validation)
5.  animations and keyframes
6.  worked with SVG's and improved knowledge of app architecture.
7.
